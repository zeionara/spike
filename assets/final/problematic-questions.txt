To generate a SPARQL query for the question "What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the TempEval-3 dataset?", you would need to know the ontology or schema that defines the properties and relationships between the relevant entities. Without that information, it is not possible to provide an accurate SPARQL query.

In the provided examples, the queries are specific to the given datasets and their corresponding ontologies. To generate a similar query for the TempEval-3 dataset, you would need to know the ontology or schema associated with that dataset and adjust the query accordingly.
